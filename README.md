**Analyzing TV Data**

In this project, you will look at Super Bowl Data, generating insights into game outcomes, viewership, and even halftime shows. After exploring and cleaning our data a little, following questions are answered:
What are the most extreme game outcomes?
How does the game affect television viewership?
How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
